Algorithms were created to find the fastest route between the two cities in the Kingdom. Where the algorithms take the map as an input

BFS, UCS, and DFS are three different algorithms for searching trees or graphs.

BFS (Breadth-First Search) is an algorithm that starts at the root node of a tree or graph and explores all the neighbor nodes first before moving to the next level. It visits all the nodes at the same level before going to the next level. BFS is guaranteed to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

UCS (Uniform-Cost Search) is an algorithm similar to BFS but with a cost associated with each edge. It explores the nodes in order of their cost, so it's guaranteed to find the path with the lowest total cost in a weighted graph.

DFS (Depth-First Search) is an algorithm that starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It goes as deep as possible in the tree until it reaches a leaf node, then it backtracks and explores other branches.

All three algorithms are commonly used in various AI and computer science applications, such as pathfinding, problem-solving, and graph traversal.
